=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh_auto_clean> [S<I<build system options>>] [S<I<debhelper options>>] [S<B<--> I<params>>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<dh_auto_clean> is a debhelper program that tries to automatically clean up
after a package build. It does so by running the appropriate command for
the build system it detects the package uses. For example, if there's a
F<Makefile> and it contains a B<distclean>, B<realclean>, or B<clean> target,
then this is done by running B<make> (or B<MAKE>, if the environment variable is
set). If there is a F<setup.py> or F<Build.PL>, it is run to clean the package.

This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn't work, or
tries to use the wrong clean target, you're encouraged to skip using
B<dh_auto_clean> at all, and just run B<make clean> manually.

=head1 OPTIONS

See L<debhelper(7)/B<BUILD SYSTEM OPTIONS>> for a list of common build
system selection and control options.

=item B<--> I<params>
