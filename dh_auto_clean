=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh_auto_clean> [S<I<debhelper options>>] [S<B<--> I<params>>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dh_auto_clean is a debhelper program that tries to automatically clean up
after a package build. If there's a Makefile and it contains a "distclean",
"realclean", or "clean" target, then this is  done by running make (or MAKE,
if the environment variable is set). If there is a setup.py or Build.PL, it
is run to clean the package.

This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn't work, or
tries to use the wrong clean target, you're encouraged to skip using
dh_auto_clean at all, and just run make clean manually.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--> I<params>

or override the any standard parameters that dh_auto_clean passes.
