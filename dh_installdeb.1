dh_installdeb \- install files into the DEBIAN directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh_installdeb
.I "[debhelper options]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_installdeb is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
files into the DEBIAN directory in package build directories with the
correct permissions.
.P
dh_installdeb automatically installs the following files from debian/ into
the DEBIAN directory:
 	postinst
 	preinst
 	postrm
 	prerm
 	shlibs
 	conffiles
.P
(For packages other than the first binary package listed in debian/control,
you must prefix these filenames with then name of the "package.", for example,
"foo.postinst". You can also prefix the filenames the same way for the first
binary package, for consitency.)
.P
The files postinst, preinst, postrm, and prerm are handled specially: If a
corresponding file named debian/script.debhelper exists, the contents of that 
file are merged into the script as follows: If the script exists, then 
anywhere in it that "#DEBHELPER#" appears, the text of the .debhelper file is
inserted. If the script does not exist, then a script is generated from 
the .debhelper file. The .debhelper files are created by other debhelper 
programs, such as 
.BR dh_installmenu (1)
, and are shell script fragments.
