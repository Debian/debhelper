dh_installemacsen \- register an emacs add on package
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh_installemacsen
.I "[debhelper options] [-n] [--priority=n] [--flavor=foo]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_installemacsen is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
files used by the debian emacsen-common package into package build directories.
.P
It also automatically generates the postinst and prerm commands needed to
register a package as an emacs add on package. See
.BR dh_installdeb (1)
for an explanation of how this works.
.P
If a file named debian/package.emacsen-install exists, then it is installed into
usr/lib/emacsen-common/packages/install/package in the package build
directory. Similarly, debian/package.emacsen-remove is installed into
usr/lib/emacsen-common/packages/remove/package . And similarly,
debian/package.emacsen-startup is installed into
etc/emacs/site-start.d/50<package>.el (by default).
