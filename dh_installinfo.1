dh_installinfo \- install and register info files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh_installinfo
.I "[debhelper options] [-A] [-n] [file ...]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_installinfo is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
info files and registering them with install-info.
.P
Any filenames specified as parameters will be installed into the first
package dh_installinfo is told to act on. By default, this is the first 
binary package in debian/control, but if you use -p, -i, or -a flags, it 
will be the first package specified by those flags.
.P
A file named debian/package.info (debian/info may be used for the first
binary package in debian/control) can list other files to be installed.
.P
dh_installinfo will automatically generate the postinst and prerm commands
needed to interface with install-info. See
.BR dh_installdeb (1)
for an explanation of how this works.

It's impossible to specify filenames with spaces or other whitespace in them
