.SH NAME
dh_installwm \- register a window manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh_installwm
.I "[debhelper options] [-n] wmfilename"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_installwm is a debhelper program that is responsible for
generating the postinst and postrm commands needed to
interface with the the
.BR register-window-manager (8)
command. This results in a window manager being registered when it is
installed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B debhelper options
See
.BR debhelper (1)
for a list of options common to all debhelper commands.
.TP
.B \-n, \--noscripts
Do not modify postinst/postrm scripts. Turns this command into a no-op.
.TP
.B wmfilename
The filename of the window manager you wish to register. May be either a
simple filename if the window manager is in /usr/X11R6/bin/, or a complete
path otherwise.
.SH NOTES
Note that this command will set up postinst and postrm scripts for every
package it acts on. It's wise to limit its action to a single package with,
for example, the -p switch.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
See
.BR debhelper (1)
for a list of environment variables that affect all debhelper commands.
.SH NOTES
Note that this command is not idempotent. "dh_clean -k" should be called
between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may cause multiple
instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.
