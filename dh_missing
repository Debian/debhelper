dh_missing - check for missing files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh_missing> [B<-X>I<item>] [B<--sourcedir=>I<dir>] [S<I<debhelper options>>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<dh_missing> compares the list of installed files with the files in
the source directory. If any of the files (and symlinks) in the source
directory were not installed to somewhere, it will warn on stderr
about that (B<--list-missing>) or fail (B<--fail-missing>).  Please
note that without either of these options, B<dh_missing> will silently
do nothing.

This may be useful if you have a large package and want to make sure that
you don't miss installing newly added files in new upstream releases.

Remember to test different kinds of builds (dpkg-buildpackage -A/-B/...) as
you may experience varying results when only a subset of the packages are
built.

=head1 FILES

=over 4

=item debian/not-installed

List the files that are deliberately not installed in I<any> binary
package.  Paths listed in this file are ignored by B<dh_missing>.
However, it is B<not> a method to exclude files from being installed
by B<dh_install>. Please use the B<--exclude> B<dh_install> option for
that.

Please keep in mind that B<dh_missing> will B<not> expand wildcards in
this file.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--list-missing>

Warn on stderr about source files not installed to somewhere.

Note that files that are excluded from being moved via the B<-X> option are not
warned about.

=item B<--fail-missing>

This option is like B<--list-missing>, except if a file was missed, it will
not only list the missing files, but also fail with a nonzero exit code.
