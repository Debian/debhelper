=head1 SYNOPSIS

Do not run!

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program used to make symlinks to the F<undocumented.7> man page for man
pages not present in a package. Debian policy now frowns on use of the
F<undocumented.7> man page, and so this program does nothing, and should not
be used.

=cut

init();
warning("This program does nothing and should no longer be used.");

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<debhelper(7)>

This program is a part of debhelper.
